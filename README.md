## Releases
Due to the nature of this project as a loosely connected collection of utilities, it's important to be strict about following [SemVer](https://semver.org/) to communicate possible breaking changes to the users of this library via version number. 

Equally as important is to be precise about the changes made in each release and maintain the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) according to the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format so users of this library can see easily where changes were made.
